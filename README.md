### Status

This repository is at a very early stage. It is only meant to demonstrate a basic collaborative editing experience and the capability of running Processing sketches on top of Codemirror, for now. It is also meant to serve as a testing ground for a few ideas to develop a modern iteration of a Processing Development Environment which incorporates a few paradigms for teaching and learning. I want to take advantage of the collaborative environment to introduce certain features like allowing educators to leave holes in the code, introducing a visual debugging environment, introducing a branch-and-climb paradigm which allows one to solve subproblems leading up to a goal, among others.
